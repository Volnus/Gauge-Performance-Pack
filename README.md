# Gauge-Performance-Pack
A performance plugin for the Gauge WordPress theme. 

This Plugin was developed to be used in conjunction with the <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/gauge-multipurpose-review-theme/8676079?ref=Destac">Gauge WordPress theme</a> it was written to reduce the load of plugins, scripts and styles on certain pages by only loading them what it is necessary. This plugin works great for sites that are using many complicated plugins such as bbPress, BuddyPress, and WooCommerce. 

In the future this plugin will come with more tweaks, fixes and changes in order to improve the performance even more through the use of conditional loading. If you like this plugin, have a suggestion or spotted an issue let me know!
